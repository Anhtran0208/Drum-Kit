# The Drum Kit website 

I learned and used advanced Javascript and DOM (Document Object Model) including addEventListener to create a website that generated sounds when users pressed keyboard. Specifically, there are a number of keys on the website that represent different drums in a typical drum set. When users click on any of these buttons or use the keys on the keyboard, they will get the corresponding sound of the drum.
